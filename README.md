# Group Element

An element to group other elements in [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant) [picture-elements](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/picture-elements/) with dynamic toggle capability.

Perfect for creating dynamic interfaces while reusing UI real-estate.

## Using the card

There are many possibe usages to the group element (samples follow below)
1. Build a cleaner user interface by showing relevant controls only when a hot spot is tapped. For example: tap your cover/blinds and show the controls; tap your dimmer and show its controls; 
No more clogged UIs or living without full control due to space contraints.
2. Easier positioining - all group children elements position and size are based on % of the group element itself. So if you have a certain element or a set of elements that you reuse you can position them once relative to each other and then move the entire group.
3. Build a dynamic UI - for example a universal remote control (TV/Receiver/STB) taking up very little space. You can combine group-element with group-toggle-button (coming soon).
4. Eliminates the need to define input_boolean entities just to toggle visibility of UI items. Also gives you freedom to use the interactive interface by multiple users without conflicts of a shared input_boolean entity.

#### Element options
| Name | Type | Default | Since | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------|-------------|

### Example usage

#### Basic setup
Group controls in a group that is initially hidden and shows when tapped

```yaml
- type: picture-elements
  image: /local/living-room.jpg
  elements:
    type: 'custom:group-element'
    toggle_tap: true
    visible: false
    style:
      height: 40%
      left: 41%
      top: 30%
      width: 25%
    - elements:
        # your elements go here - their % size/position is inside the group
```

#### Compact card
Setting either `volume` and/or `controls` to `true` in the `hide` option object will render the player as a single row.

```yaml
- type: custom:mini-media-player
  entity: media_player.example
  icon: mdi:spotify
  artwork: cover
  hide:
    volume: true
    source: true

```

## Install

### Simple install

1. Download and copy `group-element-bundle.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/yosilevy/group-element/releases/latest) into your `config/www` directory.

2. Add a reference to `group-element-bundle.js` in lovelace.

  ```yaml
  resources:
    - url: /local/group-element-bundle.js?v=0.1.0
      type: module
  ```
To do this, go to Configure UI -> Raw Config Editor and paste this under resources or use [YAML Mode](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/yaml-mode/) (not recommended))

### CLI install

1. Move into your `config/www` directory

2. Grab `group-element-bundle.js`

  ```console
  $Â wget https://github.com/yosilevy/group-element/releases/download/v0.1.0/group-element-bundle.js
  ```

3. Add a reference to `group-element-bundle.js` inside your `ui-lovelace.yaml`.

  ```yaml
  resources:
    - url: /local/group-element-bundle.js?v=0.1.0
      type: module
  ```

### *(Optional)* Add to custom updater

1. Make sure you have the [custom_updater](https://github.com/custom-components/custom_updater) component installed and working.

2. Add a new reference under `card_urls` in your `custom_updater` configuration in `configuration.yaml`.
//todo: implement tracker
  ```yaml
  custom_updater:
    card_urls:
      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yosilevy/group-element/master/tracker.json
  ```

## Updating
1. Find your `group-element-bundle.js` file in `config/www` or wherever you ended up storing it.

2. Replace the local file with the latest one attached in the [latest release](https://github.com/yosilev/group-element/releases/latest).

3. Add the new version number to the end of the cards reference url in your `ui-lovelace.yaml` like below.

  ```yaml
  resources:
    - url: /local/group-element-bundle.js?v=0.1.0
      type: module
  ```

*You may need to empty the browsers cache if you have problems loading the updated card.*

## Getting errors?
Make sure you have `javascript_version: latest` in your `configuration.yaml` under `frontend:`.

Make sure you have the latest version of `group-element-bundle.js`.

If you have issues after updating the card, try clearing your browsers cache or restart Home Assistant.

If you get "Custom element doesn't exist: group-element" or running older browsers try replacing `type: module` with `type: js` in your resource reference, like below.

```yaml
resources:
  - url: ...
    type: js
```
